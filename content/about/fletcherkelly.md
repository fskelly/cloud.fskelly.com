### My Blog

This is just my personal blog of Azure Code and Azure Experiences. I use mainly [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/overview?view=azps-1.4.0). I have other repos focused on other scripting languages like [az cli](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) and [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/) calls. I am constantly testing, changing or adding content, I try to get the code/samples as accurate as possible.
