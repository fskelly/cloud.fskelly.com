<p>With this post I am going to show you how you can easily do Azure API calls and “skip” a lot of the difficult items. I have been on something interesting tools to help my customers, when I can talk more about it, I will. As part of this tooling exercise, the Azure REST API is used extensively. With “normal” applications like APIDog, ThunderClient and the like, you often need to get a token and then add this to the header as an auth object and this involves configuration on EntraID and the like. This is not necessarily the best approach for what I was looking for. I was looking for a quick testing framework for Azure REST API calls and then look at the output to be further extracted / manipulated with JQ.</p>

<p>As I spend more time with my customers and my teams within my organization, I am learning that there a lot of aspects of Azure VMware Solution that we take for granted and simply skim over as we assume (badly) that everyone knows exactly how to &ldquo;the basics&rdquo;. With this series of &ldquo;How Do I&rdquo; posts, I am going to try and address some of the more common questions that I get asked and hopefully provide some useful information to help you on your Azure VMware Solution journey. I will endeavour to copy as many topics as I can and I am always open to ideas and suggestions. You can reach out to me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/fskelly">Twitter</a> or post a suggestion for the log on <a href="https://github.com/fskelly/flkelly-cloudblog/issues">GitHub</a> - please remember these are designed to be short and sweet and not full blown tutorials.</p>

<p>Providing people with a list of useful links and blog posts to help you get grounded in Azure VMware Solution. Some of the links are bery high-level and others are very detailed. Each link or blog post will address different items at different depths so you can hopefully find the exact link or information that you are looking for to make your journey in Azure VMware Solution a little easier.</p>

<p>I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My <a href="https://cloud.fskelly.com/post/2023/starting-wth-rest-calls-with-powershell/">previous post using API with Powershell</a> got me thinking about opening the idea to go beyond <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview">PowerShell</a>. I am very open with people around my lack of skill with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/">Azure CLI</a>, I do however want to learn some new things.</p>
<p>We also have this great technology called <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, so I figured let me dig into &ldquo;AI&rdquo; as I am a techy at heart and let me improve my skills with Azure CLI.</p>

<p>I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My <a href="https://cloud.fskelly.com/post/2023/azure-cost-management-playing-with-api-in-powershell/">first dive into cost management</a> was a big hit, so I am expanding on that. The main consideration around that particular API is that is it open. By this, I mean a simple HTTP request will return results, no authentication or additional headers or the like are needed. So nice and easy. As we dive more into API and REST API&rsquo;s, this is likely to change. This post, with more planned, is designed to make this easier and break it down into smaller chunks. THese chunks/snippets can be re-used and the principles in the chunks/snippets can be applied to other API&rsquo;s. These in particular are aimed at Azure API&rsquo;s.</p>
