      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a start to this blog post, I think it is important to understand how I see my role as a CSA (Cloud Solution Architect) with my customer. I am primarily a trusted advisor and my customers respect what I have to say, I question and challenge my customers in a constructive way to approach the challenge or problem statement in a different way. I have an amazing role of using Azure as my LEGO playpen and then building a custom solution (LEGO model) to help my customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So a question I often get asked is &amp;ldquo;what tools or products do you use?&amp;rdquo;. So I decided to do a post around the tools and technologies that I personally use on a daily basis. So to start this is what people see on my screen on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/fskelly/fletchercloud/blob/master/static/images/blogImages/vscodeScreenShot.png?raw=true&#34; alt=&#34;VSCode&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is my most common tool, Visual Studio Code, the version shown above is actually the Insiders Build. The primary reason for this tool is that is a &amp;ldquo;container&amp;rdquo; for other tools and functionality. The extra functionality is enabled with extensions, my most used extensions are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network Security Group Change Alerting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I was with a customer and they are asking for a fairly standard alert.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Please alert me when an NSG is added or modified&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. Seems simply enough, however this is not as simply as you think. So I used my favourite search and found the following, “How to receive an email on Azure Network Security Group Rule changes“, this is great content and after testing, it works exactly as expected. I just found one little concern with this approach; this is simply finding the required ID for the action group. I have now investigated and found some code to make this a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
