<p>As I spend more time with my customers and my teams within my organization, I am learning that there a lot of aspects of Azure VMware Solution that we take for granted and simply skim over as we assume (badly) that everyone knows exactly how to &ldquo;the basics&rdquo;. With this series of &ldquo;How Do I&rdquo; posts, I am going to try and address some of the more common questions that I get asked and hopefully provide some useful information to help you on your Azure VMware Solution journey. I will endeavour to copy as many topics as I can and I am always open to ideas and suggestions. You can reach out to me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/fskelly">Twitter</a> or post a suggestion for the log on <a href="https://github.com/fskelly/flkelly-cloudblog/issues">GitHub</a> - please remember these are designed to be short and sweet and not full blown tutorials.</p>

<p>Providing people with a list of useful links and blog posts to help you get grounded in Azure VMware Solution. Some of the links are bery high-level and others are very detailed. Each link or blog post will address different items at different depths so you can hopefully find the exact link or information that you are looking for to make your journey in Azure VMware Solution a little easier.</p>

<p>I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My <a href="https://cloud.fskelly.com/post/2023/starting-wth-rest-calls-with-powershell/">previous post using API with Powershell</a> got me thinking about opening the idea to go beyond <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview">PowerShell</a>. I am very open with people around my lack of skill with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/">Azure CLI</a>, I do however want to learn some new things.</p>
<p>We also have this great technology called <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">GitHub Copilot</a> and <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>, so I figured let me dig into &ldquo;AI&rdquo; as I am a techy at heart and let me improve my skills with Azure CLI.</p>

<p>I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My <a href="https://cloud.fskelly.com/post/2023/azure-cost-management-playing-with-api-in-powershell/">first dive into cost management</a> was a big hit, so I am expanding on that. The main consideration around that particular API is that is it open. By this, I mean a simple HTTP request will return results, no authentication or additional headers or the like are needed. So nice and easy. As we dive more into API and REST API&rsquo;s, this is likely to change. This post, with more planned, is designed to make this easier and break it down into smaller chunks. THese chunks/snippets can be re-used and the principles in the chunks/snippets can be applied to other API&rsquo;s. These in particular are aimed at Azure API&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I was given inspiration by a colleague, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhummerstone/">Ben Hummerstone</a> who used a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-python?tabs=asgi%2Capplication-level&amp;pivots=python-mode-configuration">Azure Python Function</a>, whilst super cool and interesting, I am a PowerShell advocate through and through. So I used PowerShell and wrote a script to show some of the use cases. This is just the tip of the iceberg and the script has been built to show some of the options available.</p>

<li>The primary focus of this script is IaaS.</li>
<li>Could be better implemented as a function. If there is enough of an ask, I might build this into a function.</li>

<li>This is a quick and dirty implementation.</li>

<p>Azure VMware Solution (AVS) offers a fully managed software defined data center based on VMware vSphere technologies in the shape of an Azure PaaS service. The PaaS nature of Azure VMware Solution results in a service that is functionally equivalent to your well-known on-premises VMware deployment you may have been using for years with some specific “restrictions” as Microsoft provides a service level agreement and therefor Microsoft is responsible for ensuring a robust and resilient platform in deployment and operation.  Azure VMware Solution is functionally equivalent to on-premises VMware but due to the PaaS nature of the service there are significant technical differences to properly consider.</p>

<h2 id="configure-dns-forwarding-prerequisite">Configure DNS forwarding prerequisite</h2>
<p>Before we can configure integration with an external identity store (e.g. Active Directory Domain Services) we need to make sure that the AVS platform components have the ability to resolve customer DNS zones hosting the LDAPS domain records. This configuration must be made through the Azure Portal blades for Azure VMware Solution.</p>

<p>These steps, for now, are run manually from the Azure Portal. This will be found &ldquo;Azure VMware Solution&rdquo; and under Operations, Run command. Then select &ldquo;New-LDAPSIdentitySource&rdquo;. An automated way of executing the run-command is in the making. Please check back soon as this article will be updated as soon as this is available.
Navigate to Azure Portal and ensure you are on AVS Private Cloud blade</p>
