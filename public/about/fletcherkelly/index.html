<p>This is just my personal blog of Azure Code and Azure Experiences. I use mainly <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/overview?view=azps-1.4.0">PowerShell</a>. I have other repos focused on other scripting languages like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest">az cli</a>, <a href="https://www.terraform.io">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/">REST API</a> calls. I am constantly testing, changing or adding content, I try to get the code/samples as accurate as possible.</p>
