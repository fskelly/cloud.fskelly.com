[{"categories":["Azure","Azure Native"],"contents":"What are we doing? I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My first dive into cost management was a big hit, so I am expanding on that. The main consideration around that particular API is that is it open. Bu this, I mean a simple HTTP request will return results, no authentication or additional headers or the like are needed. So nice and easy. As we dive more into API and REST API\u0026rsquo;s, this is likely to change. This post, with more planned, is designed to make this easier and break it down into smaller chunks. THese chunks/snippets can be re-used and the principles in the chunks/snippets can be applied to other API\u0026rsquo;s. These in particular are aimed at Azure API\u0026rsquo;s.\nConstraints / limitations Primary focus is on the Azure API. Using Azure Tokens. Enterprise Application is already registered. You have securely stored your secret for the above point. Designed to be modular - so you can run these in snippets/sections. This is NOT PRODUCTION ready yet. Lets build this Reminder, you will need to have an Application ID, Secret value and Tenant ID on hand as these are needed as part of the API call. Here is a guide for registering an Azure AD application for testing purposes. Please note that additional controls are needed for production environments.\nFor production scenarios, secret management should be used as the variables should NOT be saved in the file, but instead in a Azure Keyvault and then read out as needed in the script/function/\u0026hellip;.\nThe process flow for this is as follows.\nPerform a rest API Call to get a token -\u0026gt; Save Token in variable -\u0026gt; Use saved variable for subsequent calls.\nGet Azure AD Token In this script I am using prompts and obfuscating in the script with the use of the \u0026quot;-AsSecureString\u0026quot;. This will then save the acquired token in the $token variable.\n$tenantId = Read-Host \u0026#34;Enter your Azure tenant ID\u0026#34; $clientID = Read-Host \u0026#34;Enter your Azure client ID\u0026#34; $clientSecret = Read-host \u0026#34;enter your client secret\u0026#34; -AsSecureString $normalString = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringAuto([System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($clientSecret)) $params = @{ Uri = \u0026#34;https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenantId/oauth2/v2.0/token\u0026#34; Method = \u0026#34;POST\u0026#34; Body = @{ grant_type = \u0026#34;client_credentials\u0026#34; scope = \u0026#34;https://management.azure.com/.default\u0026#34; client_id = $clientID client_secret = $normalString } } $authResult = Invoke-RestMethod @params # Output the access token $token = $authResult.access_token Now we have our token and we can move onto the next phase, for this I am using a simple Rest API call to get my resource groups, but this token can be used for any api in the \u0026ldquo;https://management.azure.com/\u0026rdquo; scope, so this would NOT work for an Azure OpenAI Rest API call as the scope is different. A quick search with your choice of search engine will get the correct scope for that. I will create another blog about that soon.\nGetting resource groups with an API call You will see here that the API call needs authorization (US Spelling) and we are using the token from earlier \u0026ldquo;Authorization\u0026rdquo; = \u0026ldquo;Bearer $token\u0026rdquo;.\n$subscriptionId = read-host \u0026#34;Enter your subscription ID\u0026#34; $apiVersion = \u0026#34;2020-09-01\u0026#34; $headers = @{ \u0026#34;Authorization\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;Bearer $token\u0026#34; } $params = @{ Uri = \u0026#34;https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourcegroups?api-version=$apiVersion\u0026#34; Method = \u0026#34;GET\u0026#34; } $queryResult = Invoke-RestMethod @params -Headers $headers $queryResult.value | select-object -Property name,location This same principle can be applied to any API call, just change the scope and the API call. I will be adding more to this as I go along, but this is a good start.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/en/post/2023/starting-wth-rest-calls-with-powershell/","tags":["PowerShell","REST","API"],"title":"Starting Wth API Rest Calls With Powershell"}]
