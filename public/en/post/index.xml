      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-we-doing&#34;&gt;What are we doing?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am working more and more with the Azure REST APIs now. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.fskelly.com/post/2023/azure-cost-management-playing-with-api-in-powershell/&#34;&gt;first dive into cost management&lt;/a&gt; was a big hit, so I am expanding on that. The main consideration around that particular API is that is it open. Bu this, I mean a simple HTTP request will return results, no authentication or additional headers or the like are needed. So nice and easy. As we dive more into API and REST API&amp;rsquo;s, this is likely to change. This post, with more planned, is designed to make this easier and break it down into smaller chunks. THese chunks/snippets can be re-used and the principles in the chunks/snippets can be applied to other API&amp;rsquo;s. These in particular are aimed at Azure API&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
